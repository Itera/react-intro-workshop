# Tasks
The FIFA-committee needs your help! They just realized they have no production GUI for the World Cup 2018 matches, yikes!

// Todo: Tegning og bedre beskrivelse

## Task 1 - Football logo

First things first; lets spice up the app logo with a football. 
In `AppHeader.js`, swap the react logo with the football svg provided in `/content`

Change the header text from the standard react header (Welcome to react) to something that fits our project. What about "World Cup 2018 Dashboard"?

## Task 1 - ``<DashBoard />``

## Task 2 - ```<Button />```
The standard button looks pretty dull right? Let's create our button component with our own button style that we can use in the dashboard! 
In `/Button/` there a stylsheet `Button.css` which can be imported. The sheet includes the style `.button`.

Remember to use `default export  {componentName}` to make it possible for other components and pages to import the component.

## Task 3 - ``<GoalCounter />`` 

## Task 4 - ``<GameTimer />``

## Task 5 - ``<ChatBoard />``

## Task 6 - ``<MessageArea />``
Save messages in DashBoard.js state to be displayed in ChatBoard

## Task 7 - ``using third-party component; ReactPlayer``
