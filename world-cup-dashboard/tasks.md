# Tasks

## Task 1

First things first; lets spice up the app logo with a football. 
In `AppHeader.js`, swap the react logo with the football svg provided in `/content`

Change the header text from the standard react header (Welcome to react) to something that fits our project. What about "World Cup 2018 Dashboard"?
